# Weather Monitoring System

## Introduction
We are delighted to present the Weather Monitoring System, a solution designed to provide real-time weather data collection and remote monitoring capabilities. This report outlines the features, components, and benefits of our system.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of:
  - Temperature and Humidity
  - Barometric Pressure
  - Rain Detection
  - Light Levels
- Data displayed on a clear LCD screen.
- Data securely published to the cloud for remote access.
- Compact and user-friendly design.

## Components
Our system includes the following key components:
- **ESP8266 NodeMCU:** The brain of the system, providing Wi-Fi connectivity and processing power.
- **DHT11 Sensor:** Measures temperature and humidity with precision.
- **BMP180 Sensor:** Provides accurate barometric pressure data.
- **Rain Sensor:** Detects rainfall and provides valuable weather information.
- **LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor):** Monitors light levels in the environment.
- **I2C LCD Display:** Presents collected data on a user-friendly display.
